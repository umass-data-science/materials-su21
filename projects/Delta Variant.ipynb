    "**Introduction:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been identified globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Variants are determined by their genetic sequences. The term variant of interest (VOI) is used to describe a newly emerging variant for which the medical and public health importance is not yet known. If a variant is thought to be more contagious or likely to cause greater illness or severe disease, or may impact treatment or vaccine response, then it is considered a variant of concern (VOC). \n",
    "\n",
    "**What do we know about the variants of concern?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variants are associated with approximately 50% increased transmission, and likely with increased disease severity and risk of death. Appears to have minimal impact on the effectiveness of treatments with antibodies.\n",
    "- B.1.351 (Beta) variants are associated with approximately 50% increased transmission. May have moderately decreased response to antibody treatments.\n",
    "- P.1 (Gamma) variants may have moderately decreased response to some antibody treatments.\n",
    "- B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants are associated with increased transmission. May have moderately decreased response to antibody treatments. (Delta totals include Delta sub-lineages AY.1 and AY.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do we know about the Variants of Interest?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- B.1.526 (Iota) is associated with significantly reduced efficacy of some antibody treatments.\n",
    "- B.1.525 (Eta), and P.2 (Zeta) variants may have moderately decreased response to some antibody treatments.\n",
    "- B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.3 may have moderately decreased response to some antibody treatments.\n",
    "- B.1.427 and B.1.429 (Epsilon) are associated with approximately 20% increased transmission. There is significantly reduced efficacy of some antibody treatments."
